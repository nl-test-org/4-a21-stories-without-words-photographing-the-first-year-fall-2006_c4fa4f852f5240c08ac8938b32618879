The final projects of the class are presented here. The final assignment was to create a Web gallery of images that tell one or more stories culled from personal experiences at MIT. Through consultation and individual critiques with the instructor and TA, these stories were fleshed out and the sites were built. Each student chose a theme that appealed to them, and produced a Web gallery that explored that theme. The work was displayed at a final presentation, which involved showing and discussing these stories with a panel of invited guests. All the work is courtesy of the students named and used with permission.
